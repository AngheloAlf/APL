# Introduction

APL is a C based language. This language aims to include stuff C lacks, but are out of scope for C (Classes with constructors, methods and stuff; function/method/operator overload; namespaces; `String` and other built-in types; backtrace; less `undefined behavior` and `Segmentation fault (core dump)`; exceptions; and so on), and try to mantain core features (pointers; low level programming; primitive types; `Segmentation fault (core dump)`; and so on).

Don't get me wrong, I love C, but sometimes i feel like I'm writing unnecesary code over and over (want a list of your struct? let's write again a linked list/queue/stack/vector for this specific struct, that will probably has a weird edge case bug that will make me shoot in my foot).

Why don't use C++, Python, Java, or any other language that already has those features? Because they have stuff I don't like (C++ is too verbose, too big and some weird features I don't like. Python is slow, don't have typed variables. Java is Java) and lacks of important features I like (low level programming (C++ has it, but meh), pointers, low ram usage and `Segmentation fault`s). Also, I want to make my own language.

Don't expect seriousness from this language, documentation, compiler, grammar, me, or anything related to this project. This is just a fun, personal project that should not be used in any real world problem.
