# Overload and override

## Overload

Function (and method) overload allows you to provide more definitions and declarations for a function (or method) with different signatures and implementations, but same name in the same namespace/class.

## Override

Method override allows you to change the behavior of a method inherited by a parent class <sup>1</sup>. 

The method must have the same signature of the method that it is being overriding.

The method must have the same visibility of the original method.

<sup>1</sup> see the Inheritance chapter.
