# Scopes

Do I have to explain scopes?

- They work like in C.
- You can put a scope in the middle of something, so you can declare variables that will disappear at the end of the that scope.
  - If the variable' name is already defined in an outer scope, the variable in the inner scope will be used. So, no name collisions.
  - I put this here, because a lot of people don't know you can do this in C (me included a year, or so, ago).
