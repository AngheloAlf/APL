# Psuedo garbage collection

This language does not have any garbage collector running and verifiying for pointers or any kind of memory forgotten by the developer.

That said, the language provides some facilities for memory handling and other stuff, arrays, classes constructors/destructors, etc.

// TODO: expand this topic and recopilate all the "pseudo garbage collection" features, like classes constructors.
